# YouTube Shorts URL to Normal URL

## What?
This small program converts a YouTube Shorts URL (i.e. https://www.youtube.com/shorts/jiiwJx2QW-E) into a regular YouTube URL (i.e. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jiiwJx2QW-E).

## When?
I began this on 24th December 2022. It is only on GitHub as of 23rd May 2023 due to the fact that I uploaded it on that date.

## Why?
The Shorts interface is annoying. You can't scrub through the video and view specific parts, the description button is almost invisible, and the video loops over and over again. With a regular YouTube URL, you can view a YouTube Shorts as if it was just a regular (albeit portrait and short) YouTube video.

## More?
I am currently in the process of adding reading these URLs from a text file, and writing the results to a file.
